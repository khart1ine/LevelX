Thank you for purchasing the Sci-Fi Modular Pack. A lot of effort has been put into creating this asset pack and our team is more than willing to help you setup your own scenes.

Problems, help and even more suggestions are welcome.

In order to correctly set this asset pack and enjoy it certain Unity 3D settings must be set.

- Edit>Project Settings>Quality : V Sync Count: Don't Sync
- Edit>Project Settings>Player : Rendering | Color Space Linear

Two scenes are available in the pack. Rooms Scene - Realtime and Rooms Scene - Baked.  Go to Window>Lighting and check Auto for baking. Give it some time cause it is a big scene especially the Baked one.

The Baked scene is customized in the way that you see in all the promotional videos for this pack. 

Both Realtime and Baked scenes in order to work require you to check Auto Generate from the Lighting settings.

You can also use Package Manager to include the Post Processing Stack (latest version) 
Currently Post Processing Stack for 2018.1 is in Preview status. There are problems with the use of it and it is not used in the pack. You can experiment freely by using it.

If you decide to use it make sure the MainCamera is on a the layer PostProcessing and also that the Post Processing Stack scripts work on that layer. This is the correct way to set it up in Unity 2018.1


Weapons System 

You can use the mouse roll (middle button) to switch between no weapon, white weapon, brown weapon and sci-fi weapon. Also you can throw grenade by pressing the right mouse button and a smoke / emp grenade by pressing G on your keyboard.

Additional weapons can be used if you attach a game object to the WeaponManager which is attatched to the RigidbodyFPSController. 

This is a very basic weapons system used here mostly for demo purposes and to make the scenes more interesting. 

We recommend using ProGrids which is a tool recently purchased by Unity and can greatly simplify your level design work. Take a look here : https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/progrids-111425
Use use Package Manager to include it at your projects. (not necessary)
